This is my README file.

I had some trouble with spacing, mostly the vertical spacing between h tags and content below the tags. 

I also couldn't figure out how to get the word Locations to move down closer to the top of the address blocks. 

I also added the links in the menu to the different sections of the site. When you click the Featured link it takes you to the Featured section. However, it scrolls the featured section all the way to the top of the page and part of it ends up getting covered by the header. How do I adjust that so it scrolls to the section and stops at the bottom of the header?
